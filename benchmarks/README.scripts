#This readme is to setup the benchmark scripts

Run following scripts in the benchmark directory to copy files in benchmark directories, change path to the local directory

cd CINT2006
for files run_feature.sh and run_unroll.sh, change /home/vgogte/... paths to your local paths. Mainly you would have to change paths to the llvm test-suite installation directory and SPEC benchmark installation directory
Additionally, in unroll.sh, change /home/vgogte/timerFuncs.so to <your local directory>/timerFuncs.so, set 
PATH=$PATH: <your local directory> and run 
g++ -fPIC -std=c++11 -shared timerFuncs.cpp -o <your local directory>/timerFuncs.so

cd ..

cd CFP2006
for files run_feature.sh and run_unroll.sh, change /home/vgogte/... paths to your local paths. Mainly you would have to change paths to the llvm test-suite installation directory and SPEC benchmark installation directory

cd ..

LLVM_PATH="<your local llvm SOURCE path>"


cd CINT2006
for i in 4*; do cp -r $i/run_feature.sh  $LLVM_PATH/projects/test-suite/External/SPEC/CINT2006/$i/. ; done
cd ..

cd CFP2006
for i in 4*; do cp -r $i/run_feature.sh  $LLVM_PATH/projects/test-suite/External/SPEC/CFP2006/$i/. ; done
cd ..

cp TEST.simplify.Makefile ~/llvm-3.3.src/projects/test-suite/.
cp cpu*.sh ~/llvm-3.3.src/projects/test-suite/External/SPEC/CINT2006/.

Run sample file to check if files are correctly copied:
cd $LLVM_PATH/projects/test-suite/External/SPEC/CINT2006/400.perlbench/
./run_feature.sh
./run_unroll.sh 2
